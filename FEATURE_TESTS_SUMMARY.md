## 🧪 Test Patterns Used

All tests follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)** pattern:

### Example: Splash Test
```kotlin
@Test
fun `test authenticated user navigates to main screen`() {
    // Arrange
    var navigationTarget: String? = null
    val isAuthenticated = true
    
    // Act
    if (isAuthenticated) {
        navigationTarget = "MainScreen"
    } else {
        navigationTarget = "LoginScreen"
    }
    
    // Assert
    assertEquals("MainScreen", navigationTarget)
}
```

### Example: Login Test
```kotlin
@Test
fun `test empty username shows validation error`() {
    // Arrange
    var state = LoginContract.State()
    val userName = ""
    val errorMessage = "Username required"
    
    // Act
    state = state.copy(userName = userName)
    if (state.userName.isNullOrEmpty()) {
        state = state.copy(userNameError = errorMessage)
    }
    
    // Assert
    assertNotNull(state.userNameError)
    assertEquals(errorMessage, state.userNameError)
}
```

### Example: Attachment Chooser Test
```kotlin
@Test
fun `test complete attachment upload flow`() {
    // Arrange
    var state = AttachmentChooserContract.State()
    var attachments = listOf<AttachmentPicture>()
    
    // Act 1 - Initialize
    state = state.copy(isInitialized = true)
    
    // Act 2 - Add attachments
    val attachment1 = AttachmentPicture(isPdf = false, name = "image1.jpg")
    attachments = attachments + attachment1
    
    // Act 3 - Update state
    val updatedAttachment = createMockAttachmentUIModel(attachments)
    state = state.copy(attachment = updatedAttachment)
    
    // Assert
    assertTrue(state.isInitialized)
    assertEquals(1, attachments.size)
}
```
