What are the main components of the Android Application Framework?
Answer:
The Android Application Framework consists of four key building blocks:

Activities: Represent single screens with which users interact
Services: Run background operations without a user interface
Broadcast Receivers: Listen for system-wide events (incoming calls, SMS, etc.)
Content Providers: Share data between applications

These components are managed by the Application Framework layer, which provides essential services like the Activity Manager, Resource Manager, and Notification Manager.
