What is Doze Mode?
Doze Mode is a battery optimization feature introduced in Android 6.0 (API 21). When the device:

Is idle for a period of time
Screen is off
Device is unplugged

The system puts the app into Doze mode, which:

Suspends network access
Defers jobs and alarms
Stops background processes
Prevents wake locks from working properly

Result: Your background tasks may not execute or may be severely delayed.
