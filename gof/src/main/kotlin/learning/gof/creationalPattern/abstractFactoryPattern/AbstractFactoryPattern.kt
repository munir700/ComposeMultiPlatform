/**
 * âœ… Benefits:
 *
 * Adding a new client requires only adding it to the map.
 *
 * Client code does not need to change.
 *
 * Fully adheres to Open/Closed Principle.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Another Option â€” Reflection / Dependency Injection
 *
 * With DI frameworks like Dagger or Hilt, you can inject the right factory at runtime based on configuration or qualifiers, avoiding any conditional logic entirely.
