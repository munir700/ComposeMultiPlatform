Interviewer:
You’re designing a modular, large-scale Android app with both online and offline capabilities, frequent updates, and multiple development teams working in parallel.
How would you architect this app to support scalability, testability, and long-term maintenance?

Candidate:
✅ MVI with Clean Architecture: Great — shows separation of concerns, testability, and modern state handling.

✅ SQLDelight: Excellent offline DB choice, especially relevant for KMP readiness.

✅ Ktorfit: Modern and efficient HTTP client choice in Kotlin ecosystem.

✅ CI/CD, Jira, Git: Good acknowledgment of process, automation, and collaboration.

✅ Testing mindset: Calling out unit and integration testing is essential at the senior level.

Suggestions for Improvement:

Here’s how you could expand and elevate your answer to a true Senior/Lead level:

1. Structure your layers explicitly:

“I’d separate the app into feature-based Gradle modules and follow Clean Architecture — Presentation (UI/ViewModel), Domain (UseCases, interfaces), Data (Repositories, DTOs, DB).”

2. Talk about real-time and offline sync:

“I'd use StateFlow + SharedFlow in the presentation layer to manage state and events, and handle background sync using WorkManager or background coroutines with retry logic.”

3. Mention modularity:

“By modularizing into core modules like core-ui, core-network, and separate feature-* modules, we enable faster builds and independent team workstreams.”

4. Highlight testing strategy:

“All business logic lives in the Domain layer, making it easy to test using pure Kotlin unit tests. For instrumentation, I'd use Espresso and Compose Test APIs.”

5. Scalability emphasis:

“Feature flags, dynamic feature delivery, and consistent contract-driven API design help us scale both technically and across teams.”

Still a solid answer, just lacking in structure and depth for a lead-level response.
