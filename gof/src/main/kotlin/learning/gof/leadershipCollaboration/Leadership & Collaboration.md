Interviewer:
You’re leading a feature development across multiple teams — backend, iOS, QA, and design. Deadlines are tight.
How do you ensure alignment, maintain code quality, and still deliver on time?

Candidate:

Prioritizing features by scope

Selecting the design pattern (MVI for Compose/KMP)

Aligning team after architectural decisions

Creating prototypes and structure samples as a hands-on lead

Collaborating with business and UI/UX teams

Identifying core functionality early to enable parallel work

✅ What You Got Right (Well Done!)

✅ Feature prioritization: Shows awareness of scope management and MVP delivery strategy.

✅ Design pattern choice early: Ensures technical consistency and sets up the team for success.

✅ Hands-on leadership: Offering prototypes or reference implementations is a strong leadership trait.

✅ Cross-functional collaboration: Coordinating with design and business stakeholders is vital in senior roles.

✅ Enabling parallel development: Identifying “core base functionality” early is a great technique for de-risking delivery.

Sample Senior-Level Answer:

“When leading cross-team development, I follow a structured, iterative approach:

Scope & Prioritization:

I work with Product and Design to define and prioritize the core features using MoSCoW or RICE frameworks.

I break the project into phases — core, nice-to-have, and future enhancements — to manage delivery risk.

Architecture & Setup:

I align early on the design pattern (e.g., MVI + Clean Architecture for Compose/KMP).

I create prototypes or a base skeleton module to help team members understand structure, flow, and conventions.

Team Enablement:

I split the app into modular responsibilities across teams (e.g., Auth team, UI/UX team, Network/API).

I maintain alignment with weekly syncs, a shared roadmap, and clearly documented API and UI contracts.

Delivery Oversight:

I track progress using tools like Jira/ClickUp and ensure CI/CD pipelines are in place from day one.

I monitor code quality via reviews, test coverage targets, and ensure at least 1 functional build per sprint.

Adaptability:

I always plan for change — scoping decisions are re-evaluated weekly based on feedback or technical blockers.

This approach keeps the team aligned, code quality high, and business stakeholders confident in delivery.”
